# FAQ

> **HOW DOES THE HIVE WORK?**

You deposit **BNB** and receive **2.1%** of your investment every day. The percentage is fixed and will not change. As long as there is **BNB** on the balance of the contract and its support fund, rewards will be paid.



> **IS IT SAFE?**

Of course the developers don't have any access to the contract once it's launched, besides the contract has passed a security audit, the report will be available soon!



> **HOW MUCH ARE MY FEES?**

There is a total fee of 5%, It consists of Dev fee - 3% and vault fee -2%.

Dev fee is needed in order for the BNB Hive ecosystem to be developed.



> **WHAT IS A VAULT?**

A Vault is a special storage that supports the main smart contract of the hive. Each beekeeper fills out the save by 2%. This is a fund that automatically replenishes the balance of the contract if necessary. We invest it in favour of the project instead of taking this award for ourselves.



> **WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM DEPOSIT AMOUNT?**

In order for everything to be fair, we have limited the deposit that can be made from one account in the 1st week to 10 BNB and we will increase the possible deposit amount by 100% every week, so after the first week it will be possible to invest 20 BNB and so on.



> **HOW DO REFERRALS WORK?**

There are 5 lines in the BNB hive referral program with the following percentages: 10%, 7%, 5%, 3% and 1%. When you connect your wallet to the site, you will receive your referral link in a special line. When a new user buys bees after clicking your personal referral link, the contract will send BNB DIRECTLY to your wallet. All missed profit income is automatically distributed to the hive support Vault!



> **HOW OFTEN SHOULD I REINVEST?**

You can reinvest whenever you want, but minimum amount is 0.1 BNB
