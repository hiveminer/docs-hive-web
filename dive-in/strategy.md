# Strategy

There are many strategies, but the most proven strategy in such projects is the **6/1 strategy**, when users reinvest **6** times a week and collect the reward on the **7th** day. Experience shows that in this way the project will quickly gain momentum and draw more and more attention to the problem of the disappearance of bees!  

Reinvest is available from **0.1 BNB**!
